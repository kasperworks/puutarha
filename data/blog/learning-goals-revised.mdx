These are the technological tools I'm currently working on as a newsroom developer. Some of them I know decently well, at least in [relative terms](/blog/switching-lanes), some are very early doors.

The list is by no means exhaustive, but it tries to be exclusive in order to be useful.
There is a stack here to do just about anything.

The tooling areas are listed in a very rough order of priority. That is to say,
building user interfaces ranks higher than mastering bundling tools for me right now.
Yet bundling and optimizing the JavaScript bundle for browser consumption is also something I feel I need to understand better to build software in a more durable manner.

In short, big things for 2022: Serverless architecture, 3D presentations, data journalism

**The most recent list of tooling, condensed and re-oriented in December 2021**

- User interfaces: [React][1], [Next.js][2], [SolidJS][3], [Remix][4]
- Serverless API: Serverless Stack ([SST][5]), [AWS CDK][6]
- 3D visuals: [Three.js][7], [react-three-fiber][8], Blender
- Databases: [DynamoDB][9], [FaunaDB][10]
- Data visualization: [D3][11], [Visx][12]
- Hosting environments: AWS, Vercel, Cloudflare, Netlify
- Data wrangling: Python, [pandas][13]
- Fundamentals: HTML, CSS, networking, data structures
- Bundling tools: [Vite.js][14], Webpack
- Command line: bash/zsh, [jq][15], [zx][16]
- Languages to explore: [TypeScript/JSDoc][17], Go
