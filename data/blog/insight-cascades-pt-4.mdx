David Foster Wallace wrote the best description of leadership I've come across.
It's pretty long so I put it behind this pretty button.

This isn't a post about leadership specifically, but that above snippet captures a lot of
the good stuff I want to explore here.

There are remarkable parallels between modern neuroscience and ancient philosophical writings,
which also tie to the concepts of [flow](blog/insight-cascades-pt-1), [intuition](blog/insight-cascades-pt-2)
and the two [hemispheres of the brain](blog/insight-cascades-pt-3) discussed earlier in
this series of posts.

> The ideal person in Western philosophy is not only disembodied but also radically alone.

There's probably something to using myths, quotes and stories as tools to realign ourselves with
what's meaningful and durable. What has stood the test of time is likely to contain something valuable.
[Time probability](https://medium.com/incerto/the-logic-of-risk-taking-107bf41029d3) over ensemble probability.
[Lindy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect).

One of the things that has survived comes from ancient China: Tao, the way of the universe.

Everything is connected and nothing makes sense by itself. If this sounds a bit out there,
bear with me, I'll keep it short. The two key concepts to understand are **wu wei** and **de**.

Wu wei is an ability to move through the physical and social world in a completely spontaneous manner.
People in [wu wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei) have [de](https://www.britannica.com/topic/de),
a radiance that others can detect, an outward signal that one is in wu wei. Because spontaneity is hard to fake,
we intuit that people with de are trustworthy and authentic.

These concepts tie very deeply to the opening snippet on leadership. We know it when we see it.
Making all of us "do better things than we can get ourselves to do on our own."

This sort of charismatic power seems to me like a social manifestation of the flow state,
perhaps a higher form of it. It's not tied to the context of leadership, a master craftsman embodies all of these traits.
It's high-impact effortlessness in a social context. It's flowing with living things, where meaning is being made.

It's nothing, yet it's everything.
