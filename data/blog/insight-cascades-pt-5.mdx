These are things that have deeply resonated with me and I feel are extremely important for human thriving,
both on an individual and systemic level.

The balance on a societal scale is between exploration and exploitation, and present-day human culture has become
imbalanced toward exploitation. As a result of competition overpowering cooperation,
our environment is deteriorating in a very concrete way.

While modern societies are more safe and comfortable than ever, they are also characterized by
a sense of disconnection and mental illness.

I see these ideas as stepping stones or breadcrumbs we can follow, hopefully leading to a more integrated plane.
