My first programming project was a little Python script running on my mobile, which helped even out household finances. I ran it on the [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com) code playground, having picked up the basic Python syntax from their mobile mini-lessons as well as the [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) book.

For one reason or another, I didn't pursue programming seriously until several years later.

I'd had a lingering thought of building something to replace the spreadsheets my uncle always emailed ahead of a major international football tournament and a related family competition. That thought stayed with me and eventually become my first fullstack web app.

Having a clear target with defined users helped me maintain focus during my first year of learning to code, and the completion of that project marked the transition from apprentice to journeyman. Well, at least into a competent beginner. The point is, it helps to have a project in mind.
