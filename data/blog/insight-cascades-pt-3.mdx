You may be familiar with the pop-psychology caricature where the right side of the brain is the creative and emotional one,
and the left hemisphere the one in charge of logical thinking. Forget all of that.

Medical studies of brain structure indicate that it's not about which realms each side controls,
but how they approach things: the right hemisphere figures out the whole, the left hemisphere provides
precision on specific issues.

Here's a video of psychiatrist and writer Iain McGilchrist talking about it:

The right hemisphere of the brain can include observations of the left side in its insights,
but the left side cannot see what the right one is doing. The left hemisphere controls language,
but it cannot grasp metaphors or jokes. The left hemisphere lies, the right one does not.
The right hemisphere is connected to the world, the left one abstracts it.

The right brain is not necessarily virtuous, but the left cannot be. It's too focused on the detail,
the execution.

A bird needs focus to find an edible seed among the pebbles. It also needs an overall sense
of the environment to know when to fly away to avoid being eaten.

The left hemisphere sees fragments, atoms, decontextualized and static things, abstracted, mechanistic,
simplified. The right hemisphere sees a constantly moving picture in its proper context.
It perceives the bits in between that make something rich and living.

Yet without the narrow focus of the left hemisphere, one cannot have useful categories of things.

We need both.

We're good at standing back from the world, mapping and modeling it. Yet confusing the models for reality has caused many of the world's great failures.
On an individual level, it's impossible to figure out your life before you live it.

I highly recommend McGilchrist's book [The Master and his Emissary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_and_His_Emissary)
for a thorough exploration of these themes. A newer one called [The Matter With Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matter_with_Things)
looks even more promising in terms of increasing our understanding of the world.

An ideal model could be to experience the world with the right hemisphere, send leftward for
processing, then back to the right for synthesis and context.

Blindly following reason over intuition leads to behavior often accompanying mental disorders. Modern societies are imbalanced in this way.

We can also go back [a couple of thousand years](/blog/insight-cascades-pt-4) to find similar insights.
