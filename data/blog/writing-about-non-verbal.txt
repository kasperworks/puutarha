The posts in this blog always start with hand-written snippets.

I later collect the notebook scribblings and hastily torn-up pieces of paper,
type them up into [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) with some light editing,
linking and combining things that seem related. Some of the notes start forming a narrative,
and I try to let that happen. Repetition, pictures and stories help me remember the important bits.

This is especially true of the sort of heavily synthesized all-encompassing things
I'm trying to express in this post. They're very difficult to put into words,
because such things aren't primarily verbal in nature.

This is then probably a doomed effort, but it is my best attempt of catching that lightning in a bottle.

### Flow

[Flow](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/flow-theory) is a state of consciousness
where one is completely absorbed in an activity, especially something involving creative abilities.
For me, it is an aid to connect with a greater sense of meaning in life, learn important skills
faster and improve expert intuition.

Programming and writing are two activities that take me to a flow state every now and then.
When it happens, it sometimes seems to boost completely unrelated things:
an acute observation about a relationship, a mental block disappearing,
a keen sense of direction.

An [insight cascade](https://www.meaningcrisis.co/episode-2-flow-metaphor-and-the-axial-revolution/)
triggered by the mental state of flow. To happen, it requires clear information,
tightly coupled feedback loops, and an environment where errors matter. A resistance of
some sort seems essential, the task needs to be difficult enough.

I've experienced the same phenomenon playing sports as well. This is wonderful, but it has its limits.

For example, difficult video games can invoke a flow state, but they won't get a person very far
in terms of overall satisfaction in life. It's helpful to learn to flow where meaning is being made.

Preferably dealing with living things.

### Intuition

The [period](/blog/switching-lanes) in my life I've felt the most lost and despairing is also the time I consciously
suppressed intuition I couldn't explain in logical terms and reason about. Equally,
many of the best decisions I've ever made were driven by a strong innate desire, even if I couldn't
explain it at the time. Or still.

It seems to me the [Western thought](https://www.britannica.com/event/Enlightenment-European-history)
I have been immersed in since childhood has a false dualism between intuition and intellect,
emotion and rationality. The body and the mind are not separate, Descartes had it wrong.
[Neuroscience](https://scitechconnect.elsevier.com/brief-history-explanation/) seems to support that stance.

The main problem here is that the narrow focus of verbalized rationality has come to dominate absolutely everything.
The left hemisphere of the brain has taken over, leaving us poorer for it.

Here's psychiatrist and writer Iain McGilchrist on the topic:

<YTPlayer url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFs9WO2B8uI" />

Forget the pop-psychology caricature where the right side of the brain is the creative and emotional one,
and the left hemisphere the one in charge of logical thinking. It's not about which realms each
side of the brain controls, but how they approach things: the right side figures out the whole,
the left side provides precision on specific issues.

The right hemisphere of the brain can include observations of the left side in its insights,
but the left side cannot see what the right one is doing. The left hemisphere
controls language, but it cannot grasp metaphors or jokes. The left hemisphere lies,
the right one does not. The right hemisphere is connected to the world, the left one abstracts it.

It doesn't mean that operating by vibes is desireable, it's important to do the work
and understand the environment and variables within. Without the narrow focus of the left hemisphere,
one cannot have useful categories of things. We need both. It's just that verbalized reasoning is
limited and can easily lead people astray.

An ideal model could be to experience the world with the right hemisphere,
send leftward for processing, then back to the right for synthesis and context.
Follow the intuition on what seems promising, make a sanity check to see if it makes any sense at all,
then leave the decision-making to intuition.

I highly recommend McGilchrist's book [The Master and his Emissary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_and_His_Emissary)
for a thorough exploration of these themes.

We can also go back a couple of thousand of years to find similar insights.

### Tao

> The ideal person in Western philosophy is not only disembodied but also radically alone.

There's probably something to using myths, quotes and stories as tools to
realign ourselves with what's meaningful and durable. What has stood the test of time
is likely to contain something valuable.

This something is what people in ancient China called the Tao, the way of the universe.
Everything is connected and nothing makes sense by itself.

If this sounds a bit out there, bear with me, I'll keep it short. The two key concepts
to understand are **wu wei** and **de**.

Wu wei is an ability to move through the physical and social world in a completely spontaneous manner.
People in [wu wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei) have [de](https://www.britannica.com/topic/de),
a radiance that others can detect, an outward signal that one is in wu wei. Because spontaneity is hard to fake,
we intuit that people with de are trustworthy and authentic.

David Foster Wallace perfectly captured this sort of natural leadership in words:

> The weird thing is that the word “leader” itself is cliché and boring,
> but when you come across somebody who actually is a real leader,
> that person isn't cliché or boring at all; in fact he's sort of the opposite of cliché and boring.
> Obviously, a real leader isn't just somebody who has ideas you agree with,
> nor is it just somebody you happen to believe is a good guy. Think about it.
>
> A real leader is somebody who, because of his own particular power and charisma and example,
> is able to inspire people, with “inspire” being used here in a serious and non-cliché way.
> A real leader can somehow get us to do certain things that deep down we think are good and
> want to be able to do but usually can't get ourselves to do on our own.
>
> It's a mysterious quality, hard to define, but we always know it when we see it, even as kids.
> You can probably remember seeing it in certain really great coaches, or teachers,
> or some extremely cool older kid you “looked up to” (interesting phrase) and wanted to be just like.
>
> Some of us remember seeing the quality as kids in a minister or rabbi, or a scoutmaster, or a parent,
> or a friend's parent, or a supervisor in a summer job. And yes, all these are “authority figures,”
> but it's a special kind of authority.
>
> If you've ever spent time in the military, you know how incredibly easy it is to tell
> which of your superiors are real leaders and which aren't, and how little rank has to do with it.
> A leader's real “authority” is a power you voluntarily give him, and you grant him this authority
> not with resentment or resignation but happily; it feels right.
>
> Deep down, you almost always like how a real leader makes you feel,
> the way you find yourself working harder and pushing yourself and thinking in ways you couldn't
> ever get to on your own.
>
> In other words, a real leader is somebody who can help us overcome the limitations of our
> own individual laziness and selfishness and weakness and fear and get us to do better things
> than we can get ourselves to do on our own.

### Slack

The spontaneous effortlessness in a social context ties together neuroscience and culture,
situational awareness and a mastered skill.

For such things to happen, it seems to be beneficial to have some slack, some inefficiency in the system.
If there's none, there's little space for insights emerging from intuition. Creativity
and grace are not easily optimized.

I don't know what it all means, but I'm determined to pursue it. The stuff that sticks
with you is trying to tell you something. Better to dance than fight against it.
