David Foster Wallace wrote the best description of leadership I've come across.
It's pretty long so I put it behind this pretty button.

This isn't a post about leadership specifically, but that above snippet captures a lot of good stuff that's relevant
to the themes I want to explore here.

It's about spontaneous effortlessness in a social context, braiding together neuroscience and culture,
situational awareness and mastered skills. It's a distillation of a few of the most consequential books, articles and
conversations I've enjoyed over the past year and a half. Much of it has emerged from personal turmoil.

It's a particularly challenging theme, as I feel the core tenets of what I want to say are non-verbal in nature.
It gets a bit woo. I have given it my best shot regardless.

### Let's consider flow

[Flow](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/flow-theory) is a state of consciousness
where one is completely absorbed in an activity, especially something involving creative abilities.
For me, it is an aid to connect with a greater sense of meaning in life, learn important skills
faster and improve expert intuition.

Programming and writing are two activities that take me to a flow state every now and then.
When it happens, it sometimes seems to boost completely unrelated things:
an acute observation about a relationship, a mental block disappearing,
a keen sense of direction.

An [insight cascade](https://www.meaningcrisis.co/episode-2-flow-metaphor-and-the-axial-revolution/)
triggered by the mental state.

Prerequisites for a flow state are an ability to continuously and quickly adjust to feedback,
and an environment where errors matter. A resistance of some sort also seems essential,
the task needs to be difficult enough.

I've experienced the same phenomenon playing amateur sports too. This is wonderful, but it has its limits.

For example, difficult video games can invoke a flow state, but they won't get a person very far
in terms of overall satisfaction in life. It's helpful to learn to flow where meaning is being made.

Preferably dealing with living things.

### Intuition

The [period](/blog/switching-lanes) in my life I've felt the most lost and despairing is also the time I consciously
suppressed intuition I couldn't explain in logical terms and reason about. Equally,
many of the best decisions I've ever made were driven by a strong innate desire, even if I couldn't
explain it at the time. Or still.

It seems to me the [Western thought](https://www.britannica.com/event/Enlightenment-European-history)
I have been immersed in since childhood has a false dualism between intuition and intellect,
emotion and rationality. The body and the mind are not separate, Descartes had it wrong.
[Neuroscience](https://scitechconnect.elsevier.com/brief-history-explanation/) seems to support that stance.

The main problem here is that the narrow focus of verbalized rationality has come to dominate absolutely everything.
The left hemisphere of the brain has taken over, leaving us poorer for it.

### Hemispheres

Forget the pop-psychology caricature where the right side of the brain is the creative and emotional one,
and the left hemisphere the one in charge of logical thinking.

Medical studies of brain structure indicate that it's not about which realms each side controls,
but how they approach things: the right hemisphere figures out the whole,
the left hemisphere provides precision on specific issues.

Here's psychiatrist and writer Iain McGilchrist:

<YTPlayer url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFs9WO2B8uI" />

The right hemisphere of the brain can include observations of the left side in its insights,
but the left side cannot see what the right one is doing. The left hemisphere
controls language, but it cannot grasp metaphors or jokes. The left hemisphere lies,
the right one does not. The right hemisphere is connected to the world, the left one abstracts it.

While one shouldn't dissect the life out of every living thing, operating by pure vibes is not desireable either.
It's important to do the work and understand the environment and variables within.
Without the narrow focus of the left hemisphere, one cannot have useful categories of things.
We need both.

I highly recommend McGilchrist's book [The Master and his Emissary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_and_His_Emissary)
for a thorough exploration of these themes. A newer one called [The Matter With Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matter_with_Things)
looks even more promising in terms of increasing our understanding of the world.

An ideal model could be to experience the world with the right hemisphere,
send leftward for processing, then back to the right for synthesis and context.
Follow the intuition on what seems promising, make a sanity check to see if it makes any sense at all,
then leave the decision-making to intuition.

The goal is not to ditch reason, but to boost subtle intuitions we don't fully understand yet. A concrete example of a person
embracing this kind of approach with great success is [Arnold Van Den Berg](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/richer-wiser-happier/master-your-mind-w-arnold-van-den-berg/),
a Holocaust survivor who taught himself to invest and has successfully managed money for almost half a century.

We can also go back a couple of thousand of years to find similar insights.

There's probably something to using myths, quotes and stories as tools to
realign ourselves with what's meaningful and durable. What has stood the test of time
is likely to contain something valuable. [Time probability](https://medium.com/incerto/the-logic-of-risk-taking-107bf41029d3)
over ensemble probability. [Lindy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect).

One of the things that has survived comes from ancient China: Tao, the way of the universe.
Everything is connected and nothing makes sense by itself.

If this sounds a bit out there, bear with me, I'll keep it short. The two key concepts
to understand are **wu wei** and **de**.

Wu wei is an ability to move through the physical and social world in a completely spontaneous manner.
People in [wu wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei) have [de](https://www.britannica.com/topic/de),
a radiance that others can detect, an outward signal that one is in wu wei. Because spontaneity is hard to fake,
we intuit that people with de are trustworthy and authentic.

These concepts tie very deeply to the opening snippet on leadership from David Foster Wallace. We know it when we see it.
Making all of us "do better things than we can get ourselves to do on our own."

This sort of charismatic power seems to me like a social manifestation of the flow state,
perhaps a higher form of it. It's not tied to the context of leadership, a master craftsman embodies all of these
traits. It's high-impact effortlessness in a social context. It's nothing, yet it's everything.

### Stepping stones

These are things that have deeply resonated with me and I feel are extremely important for human thriving, both on an individual
and systemic level.

The balance on a societal scale is between exploration and exploitation, and present-day human culture has become
imbalanced toward exploitation. As a result of competition overpowering cooperation, our environment is deteriorating in a very concrete way.

While modern societies are more safe and comfortable than ever, they are also characterized by a sense of disconnection and mental illness.

The [highest-earning movies](https://thekcpgroup.com/insights/the-attention-span-invisible-war) of recent years share the same narrative structure,
the [Hero's journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey). It describes a transition of consciousness: it's in every superhero origin story, it's the story of the prophet and the shaman,
the healer's story. It's a story of crossing the bridge, overcoming adversity.

Odds are that the stuff that appeals to you is trying to tell you something. I see these ideas as stepping stones or breadcrumbs we can follow,
hopefully leading to a more integrated plane.

Let me know if any of this evoked any thoughts: I'd love to spar with more people on these topics and hear further recommendations.
