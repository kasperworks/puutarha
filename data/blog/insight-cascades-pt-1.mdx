These texts are unlike anything I've ever written.

They are a distillation of the most memorable books, articles and conversations
I've enjoyed over the past couple of years. Much of the output has emerged
in the wake of personal turmoil.

It's been particularly challenging to write, as I feel the core tenets
of what I want to say are non-verbal in nature. It gets a bit woo.

A big reason I wanted to share this stuff is because I'd love to spar with
more people on these topics, thus feedback is very welcome!

### Flow

Let start with [flow:](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/flow-theory)
a state of consciousness where one is completely absorbed in an activity,
especially something involving creative abilities.

There's a sense of unity with the environment, a loss of self-consciousness,
an ongoing sense of discovery. Even though you're expending energy, it feels effortless.
It's rare and precious. For me, it is an aid to connect with a greater sense of meaning in life,
learn important skills faster and improve expert intuition.

In order for the flow state to occur, there needs to be clarity of information. No ambiguity or vagueness.
Feedback needs to be tightly coupled: no big time lag to detect a response from the environment after
an action. A resistance of some sort also seems essential, the task needs to be difficult enough
and errors need to be meaningful.

Playing music, partaking in amateur sports, programming and writing are activities where I've
experienced flow. When it happens, it sometimes seems to boost completely unrelated things:
an acute observation about a relationship, a mental block disappearing, a keen sense of direction.

triggered by the mental state.

However, you only get so far with flow.

> promoting it might not lead to desirable qualities of character; just as likely it could yield
> an atomised society of sophisticated hedonists with gaming addictions and virtual-reality sickness.

For example, difficult video games can invoke a flow state, but they won't get a person very far
in terms of overall satisfaction in life. It's helpful to learn to flow where meaning is being made.
Preferably dealing with living things.

Flow is also helpful in making implicit learning happen.

[Implicit learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/implicit-learning) is a concept
that has been studied since the 1960s and it has replicated well. It means a process where
information is learned outside of conscious awareness.

Sometimes explicitly describing a pattern hinders learning. For example, how close do you stand
next to a person at a funeral? There's a lot that goes into it: status, closeness to the person,
past history and so on. It's actually quite difficult to describe in its entirety,
and going to a funeral school probably would not have been helpful. Yet you know how to do it.

Implicit learning is where **intuition** comes from. That's the next [topic](/blog/insight-cascades-pt-2).
