After practice, I bought a club-branded rash guard and velcro shorts from the main man.

I ordered a gi, a white belt and a mouth guard on the cheap. The gi is still in the mail, but I washed the white belt and set it coiled on the edge of a wardrobe shelf, where I can see it. I’ve rolled in a t-shirt and mid-length swimming shorts. My elbows and feet have skin burnt off in several places by the foam mats.

They are tokens of a recent glimpse into a new reality. A reality that can be reached by taking off your shoes, washing your feet and walking onto the mats.
Once there, someone 15kg heavier than you will place their knee upon your belly, and commence to slowly twist you into a pretzel.

This will be a useful lesson to you.

I have something called contused costal cartilage, which means it hurts to sit up in the morning.

I think about levers, frames and posture.

I have an amplified sense of being alive.

Sincerely,

A first-week Brazilian jiu-jitsu white belt 10 hours in, coming back from a first-month rib injury.
