The one thing I would like to tell myself from a few years back is that intuition
is a lot more powerful and takes into account much more than you give it credit for.

The [period](/blog/switching-lanes) in my life I've felt the most lost and despairing
is also the time I consciously suppressed intuition I couldn't explain in logical
terms and reason about. Equally, many of the best decisions I've ever made were
driven by a strong innate desire, even if I couldn't explain it at the time. Or still.

It seems to me the [Western thought](https://www.britannica.com/event/Enlightenment-European-history)
I have been immersed in since childhood has a false dualism between intuition and intellect,
emotion and rationality. The body and the mind are not separate, Descartes had it wrong.

[Neuroscience](https://scitechconnect.elsevier.com/brief-history-explanation/) seems to support
that stance.

Yet intuition can also go wrong, turning into prejudice or false assumptions.

The goal is not to ditch reason, but to boost subtle intuitions we don't fully understand yet.
Follow intuition on what seems promising, conduct a sanity check to see if it makes any sense at all,
then leave the decision-making to intuition.

Returning to the previous topic of flow, the three principles of clarity, feedback and
meaningful errors seem helpful in cultivating the right kind of intuition. If you're a rock climber,
you will find out whether you're genuinely right or wrong quickly.

Investing is another field where this kind of thinking could be helpful, as expressed by Warren Buffett:

> Interestingly enough, although I consider myself to be primarily in the quantitative school,
> the really sensational ideas I have had over the years have been heavily weighted toward
> the qualitative side where I have had a “high-probability insight”.
> This is what causes the cash register to really sing.

Another example of a person embracing this kind of approach even more fully
with great success is [Arnold Van Den Berg](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/richer-wiser-happier/master-your-mind-w-arnold-van-den-berg/),
a Holocaust survivor who taught himself to invest and has successfully managed money for almost half a century.

/// TODO: Add stuff about the gorilla in the basketball court, Jobs at Xerox PARC

Steve Jobs seeing the gorilla in Xerox PARC

The closest thing in the history of computing to a Prometheus myth is the **late 1979 visit to Xerox PARC by a group of Apple engineers and executives led by Steve Jobs.** According to early reports, it was on this visit that Jobs discovered the mouse, windows, icons, and other technologies that had been developed at PARC.

The gorilla on the basketball court! It doesn’t mean other people in the industry or the world weren’t rational or ignored the blindingly obvious. What’s in your field of vision is not the interesting question.

I suspect it's a fairly common cognitive pattern where the rational mind tries to actively discredit
intuition, to everyone's detriment. More on that in the [next chapter](blog/insight-cascades-pt-3).
