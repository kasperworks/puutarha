### Books

**Pienen hauen pyydystys**, Juhani Karila

Finnish mythology in modern-day Lapland, magical realism without mannerisms. A unique story and a brilliant reading by Anna Saksman in Finnish. I understand ”Fishing for the little pike” is about to be translated to a number of languages, including English. Deservedly so.

**Trying Not to Try**, Edward Slingerland

This book opened up Tao for me in a way that felt very grounded. Then the ground opened up and it's been a ride ever since.

**Tao Te Ching**, Laozi

I'm a couple of thousand years late to this, but wow. I tend to browse this on my phone every now and then, reading here and there. There's usually something centering.
I like [this translation](https://terebess.hu/english/tao/gia.html) by Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English.

**Where Is My Flying Car?**, J. Storrs Hall

An energizing, ambitious and provocative future vision of progress, written by a scientist. Bring on personal airships, let's increase the watts at everyone's disposal!

The main thesis is summarized well in [this review](https://rootsofprogress.org/where-is-my-flying-car). A tigher edit would've helped the book, as sometimes the
aviation deep dives cause a bit of a whiplash with the political polemic. Also while I feel I can appreciate both Woodstock '69 and Apollo 11, and I don't think
public transport is ”worthless”, I do respect the author for taking a stance and sticking to it tenaciously.

The viewpoint is argued in a compelling way, well supported by analysis and ultimately grounded in numbers. There's a lot to think about here.

> What I would really like to do is float along over the ocean at
> about 3,000 feet in an open-decked airship, mai tai in hand,
> watching the endlessly fascinating cloudscapes, the spectacular
> sunsets, while being wafted from island to island by the trade winds.

**Consolations**, David Whyte

Everyday words described in a way that bypasses all defenses. I've returned to parts of this book all through the year, ever since discovering it at the start of 2022.
Top recommendation for the audio version, narrated by the poet himself.

**Xenos trilogy**, Dan Abnett

Something of a guilty pleasure, I blew past these three novels narrated by the masterful Toby Longworth in a matter of weeks.
Hercules Poirot and James Bond in the Warhammer 40K universe.

**Alchemy**, Rory Sutherland

Deep and funny observations from a seasoned practitioner. Top marks for the audiobook read by the ad man himself.

### Podcasts

**Controlling Your Dopamine for Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction**, Huberman Lab

**Boyd Varty — The Lion Tracker's Guide to Life**, The Tim Ferriss Show

### Games

**Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge**

A massive nostalgia trip, had a blast going through it in a co-op session among four good friends. About the length of a movie, the game is exactly like in the 1990s but better! Mike Patton does the theme song, Raekwon and Ghostface a boss-fight tune.

### Movies, TV Series

**Everything Everywhere All at Once**

**Better Call Saul (season 6)**

Probably better than Breaking Bad. Definitely the best spinoff ever made.

### Music

**Space**, Somali Yacht Club

**What’s Going On (The Detroit Mix)**, Marvin Gaye

Somehow an even better mix of what was already a stone-cold classic.

**MVP**, ISVVC

Any number of beats produced by this guy, really. So many good tracks. But were I to choose one, these
Big L verses laid over a whole new vibe hit the hardest.

**POTSLOJO**, Bad Sauna
