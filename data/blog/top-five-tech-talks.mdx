[Jonathan Blow - Preventing the Collapse of Civilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW-SOdj4Kkk)

Technological progress is not a given. This one made me want to learn compilers and low-level languages.

[Rich Hickey - Hammock-Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)

Sometimes the best thing is to walk away from the computer. An excellent overview on focused and diffuse modes of thinking.

[Bret Victor - Inventing on Principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwXt90ZqA)

On the importance of fast feedback when creating something new.

[Cory House - The 7 Pillar Developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nks_Fb5TUjs)

Some very actionable principles on how to approach a career as a developer.

[Liz Rice - Containers From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=8fi7uSYlOdc)

By far the best explanation I've seen on how containers work, and one of the most insightful videos on Linux in general too. I don't even know Go, didn't matter at all.
