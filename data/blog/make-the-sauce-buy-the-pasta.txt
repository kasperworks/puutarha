There's a pattern in how I cook.

When making a plate of pasta, I tend to take great care plucking
basil leaves for the tomato sauce, or really focus on folding the raw eggs into
a carbonara. As for the spaghetti, whatever, as long as it's not boiled soggy.

I'm not much of a baker, and the quality of the factory-made pasta I can buy is steady.
I'm fairly sure I wouldn't miss any single brand of carbohydrate goodness for very long,
as the one next to it on the shelf is in all likelihood 95% as good.

A good sauce I remember for a long time.

It's unlikely that any one person is going to have an edge in 10 different things.
The good news is that one or two is enough, given full attention.

Trade money for time to be able to focus on what you're amazing at.

- Frontend is the sauce, backend is the pasta -- for me
- Up until when, what is the right abstraction level and primitives?
- Heavy lifting on the backend is commoditized
- Supabase vs AWS in serverless, not an easy choice
- Full control in everything or limited and abstracted somewhere?
- How do you want to do stuff?
- Lego blocks, primitives
- APIs all the way down
- Books are APIs
- UI / DB / Functions / Storage / Auth

One of my favorite books starts like this:

> When the phone rang I was in the kitchen, boiling a potful of spaghetti and
> whistling along to an FM broadcast of the overture to Rossini's The Thieving Magpie,
> which has to be the perfect music for cooking pasta.
