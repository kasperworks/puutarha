A main character in one of my favorite books often cooks pasta by himself.

When I first read it, I was a student living in a shared flat in the Netherlands,
and oftentimes I fed myself the same way.

> When the phone rang I was in the kitchen, boiling a potful of spaghetti and
> whistling along to an FM broadcast of the overture to Rossini's The Thieving Magpie,
> which has to be the perfect music for cooking pasta.

I took great care plucking some basil leaves for the tomato sauce,
or folding the eggs into a carbonara, and just generally thought about pasta sauces
more than most people around me.

As for the sauce vehicle, I never thought about it too much, just taking care to not 
boil it soggy. I think about internet businesses this way too.

### APIs

- Frontend is the sauce, backend is the pasta
- Up until when, what is the right abstraction level and primitives?
- Heavy lifting on the backend is commoditized
- Supabase vs AWS in serverless, not an easy choice
- Full control in everything or limited and abstracted somewhere?
- How do you want to do stuff?
- Lego blocks, primitives
- APIs all the way down
- Books are APIs
- Focus on the differentiator, the stuff you enjoy
- UI / DB / Functions / Storage / Auth
