I was miserable.

I lived in one of the greatest cities in the world, had a respectable position in one of the best companies in my line of work, and was about to become a father. I knew I was fortunate.

Yet there was a primitive and guttural alarm inside me signaling that if I stayed the course, something terrible was going to happen. I ignored it.

My general enjoyment of most things steadily faded, until more than a year later, I caught a lifeline. Thankfully, this happened before I had absent-mindedly let everything dear to me float away.

### Distress signal decoded

I started dabbling in computer programming. Learning new thought patterns, solving tough problems, speaking a completely new language unlike any I knew before. Thrilled about the challenge I had unveiled, I threw myself into code with resurfaced vigor.

This felt like a thing I'd been missing. I was typing away at least a couple of hours every night for months on end, after the little one had gone to sleep. Then again, London was locked down and there wasn't a whole lot else to do anyway.

ES6+ syntax with functional programming techniques. Immutable, unidirectional data flows. Declarative and imperative paradigms, relational and non-relational databases. Little by little, my Swiss-cheese knowledge was filling in.

Sustained effort is not magic, although the outcome still regularly feels like it. There's also no need for anyone's permission or significant resources to get going.

### Fitness landscapes

When it comes to pursuing programming as a serious career option, what may be a bigger hurdle is overcoming one's ego. Like any new language, you'll feel like an idiot every time you try to speak it, until you stop caring.

More generally, changing careers means sliding down the slope of your local peak, setting out to find a more fulfilling vantage point. It's a whole new mountain to climb and there are no guarantees.

For me, the specific hurdle was nine years of fairly high-profile experience in financial journalism and industry-standard [qualifications](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa) that I'd spent about 1,000 hours on obtaining.

The way I saw it, entering a new field was unlikely to match what I had. Probably not in terms of salary, almost definitely not in terms of prestige or meaningful decisions available. Nor the fuzzy warm feeling of actually knowing what you're doing.

### Chase your bliss

In the end, it wasn't a tough choice. It just required paying attention to that internal alarm and dusting off the compass next to it. I'm a lot happier now.

One of the most fortunate coincidences for me is that creating things yourself is the only way to really understand how the whole modern web stack comes together.

That's also the most gratifying part, the new-found ability to create, accompanied by a need to do so. That's at the core of what code means for me.

If you're interested in the specific resources I used to make this career switch, I've curated the best ones [in this post](/blog/starter-pack). There are no affiliate connections, just trying to pass it forward.

Listen to the signals, observe the compass.

Don't despair.
