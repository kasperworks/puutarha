I lived in one of the greatest cities in the world, had a respectable position in one of the best companies in my line of work, and had just become a father. I was drowning.

There was a primitive and guttural alarm inside me signaling that if I kept moving in this direction, something terrible was going to happen. I ignored it.

Eventually, what rescued me was code. Learning new thought patterns, solving tough problems, speaking a completely new language unlike any I knew before. I'm grateful for code.

In my personal experience, learning to code enough to be employable will require spending a big chunk of your free time immersed in the subject for about a year. This process may be faster if you don't need to work a full-time job and be a parent, but it's possible to accomplish even with such responsibilities.

What may be a bigger hurdle is overcoming your ego, sliding down the slope of your local peak, hoping to find another, more fulfilling one to climb.

In my case, the hurdle was in the form of almost a decade of fairly high-profile experience in financial journalism and industry-standard [qualifications](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa), which meant that an entry-level position in a new field wasn't going to match what I had. Probably not in salary, definitely not in prestige or meaningful decisions available.

In the end it wasn't a tough choice. It just required paying attention to that internal alarm and the compass pointing to one specific direction. I'm a lot happier now. I no longer [end weeks with nothing](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing).

If you're interested in the specific resources I used to make this switch, I've listed the best ones [in this post](/blog/starter-pack). I'll keep general career advice to a minimum, with a priority on acquiring skills.

One of the most fortunate coincidences is that creating things yourself is the only way to really learn how the whole modern web stack comes together. That's also the most gratifying part for me, the new-found ability to create, accompanied by a need to do so. That's at the core of what code means for me. It has made music sound better.

Listen to the signals, observe the compass.

Don't despair.
