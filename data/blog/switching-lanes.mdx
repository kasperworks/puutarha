I was miserable.

I lived in one of the greatest cities in the world, had a respectable position in one of the best companies in my line of work, and was about to become a father. I felt competent and knew I was fortunate.

Yet there was a primitive and guttural alarm inside me signaling that if I stayed the course, something terrible was going to happen. I ignored it.

More than a year later, I caught a lifeline. Thankfully, this happened before I'd absent-mindedly let everything dear to me float away.

### Distress signal decoded

I started dabbling in computer programming. Learning new thought patterns, solving tough problems, speaking a completely new language unlike any I knew before. Thrilled about the challenge I had unveiled, I threw myself into code with resurfaced vigor.

Learning to program well enough to make it your primary source of income will require immersing yourself in code for about a year, perhaps less if you don't need to work a full-time job and be a parent.

For me, that meant typing away at least a couple of hours every night for months on end, after the little one had gone to sleep. Then again, London was locked down and there wasn't a whole lot else to do anyway.

While individual circumstances will always vary, an important point is that it's possible to learn to code with a reasonable amount of sustained effort. It's not magic, although the outcome still regularly feels like it. You also don't need anyone's permission or significant resources to get started.

### Fitness landscapes

What may be a bigger hurdle is overcoming your ego. Like any new language, you'll feel like an idiot every time you try to speak it, until you stop caring. More generally, changing careers means sliding down the slope of your local peak, setting out to find a more fulfilling vantage point. It's a whole new mountain to climb and there are no guarantees.

For me, the specific hurdle was nine years of fairly high-profile experience in financial journalism and industry-standard [qualifications](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa) that I'd spent about 1,000 hours on obtaining.

The way I saw it, entering a new field was unlikely to match what I had. Probably not in terms of salary, almost definitely not in terms of prestige or meaningful decisions available. Nor the fuzzy warm feeling of knowing what you're doing.

In the end it wasn't a tough choice, it just required paying attention to that internal alarm and dusting off the compass next to it. I'm a lot happier now. I don't [end weeks with nothing.](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing)

One of the most fortunate coincidences is that creating things yourself is the only way to really understand how the whole modern web stack comes together.

That's also the most gratifying part for me, the new-found ability to create, accompanied by a need to do so. That's at the core of what code means for me. It has made music sound better, for some reason.

If you're interested in the specific resources I used to make this switch, I've listed the best ones [in this post](/blog/starter-pack).

Listen to the signals, observe the compass.

Don't despair.
