I lived in one of the greatest cities in the world, had a respectable position in one of the best companies in my line of work, and had just become a father. I felt competent. I was drowning.

There was a primitive and guttural alarm inside me signaling that if I stayed the course, something terrible was going to happen. The feeling was stronger by the day. I ignored it.

More than a year later, I caught a lifeline: code.

Learning new thought patterns, solving tough problems, speaking a completely new language unlike any I knew before. I threw myself into it with rediscovered vigor. Thankfully, this happened before I'd absent-mindedly let everything dear to me fade away, which I'm now convinced would've happened otherwise.

In my personal experience, learning to write a programming language well enough to make it your primary source of income will require immersing yourself in code for about a year, perhaps less if you don't need to work a full-time job and be a parent.

For me, that meant typing away at least a couple of hours every night for months on end, after the little one had gone to sleep. Then again, London was locked down and there wasn't a whole lot else to do anyway.

While individual circumstances will vary, an important point I want to make is that it's possible to learn to code with reasonable effort, and you don't need anyone's permission or significant resources to get started.

What may be a bigger hurdle is overcoming your ego. Like any new language, you'll feel like an idiot every time you try to speak it, until you stop caring. More generally, changing careers means sliding down the slope of your local peak, setting out to find a more fulfilling vantage point. It's a whole new mountain to climb and there are no guarantees.

For me, the specific hurdle was nine years of fairly high-profile experience in financial journalism and industry-standard [qualifications](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa), which meant that entering a new field was unlikely to match what I had. Probably not in terms of salary, almost definitely not in terms of prestige or meaningful decisions available. That's what I thought anyway.

In the end it wasn't a tough choice. It just required paying attention to that internal alarm and a compass pointing to one specific direction. I'm a lot happier now. I don't [end weeks with nothing.](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing)

One of the most fortunate coincidences is that creating things yourself is the only way to really understand how the whole modern web stack comes together. That's also the most gratifying part for me, the new-found ability to create, accompanied by a need to do so. That's at the core of what code means for me. It has made music sound better.

If you're interested in the specific resources I used to make this switch, I've listed the best ones [in this post](/blog/starter-pack).

Listen to the signals, observe the compass.

Don't despair.
