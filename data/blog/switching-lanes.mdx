I lived in one of the greatest cities in the world, had a respectable position in one of the best companies in my line of work, and had just become a father. I was drowning.

There was a primitive and guttural alarm inside me signaling that if I kept moving in this direction, something terrible was going to happen. I ignored it.

What shook me awake was code. Learning new thought patterns, solving tough problems, speaking a completely new language unlike any I knew before. Thankfully, I came upon this lifeline before absent-mindedly destroying everything dear to me, which I'm almost certain would've eventually happened otherwise.

In my personal experience, learning to write a programming language well enough to make it your primary source of income will require spending a big chunk of your free time immersed in the subject for about a year, perhaps less if you don't need to work a full-time job and be a parent. Of course, I was lucky to find a position to leverage my domain expertise for an initial foothold. While individual circumstances may vary, I believe it's possible to accomplish with reasonable effort, and you don't need anyone's permission or significant resources to get started.

In a case like mine, what may be a bigger hurdle is overcoming your ego. Changing careers often means sliding down the slope of your local peak, hoping to find another, more fulfilling vantage point. It's a whole new mountain to climb and there are no guarantees.

For me, the specific hurdle was nine years of fairly high-profile experience in financial journalism and industry-standard [qualifications](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa), which meant that entering a new field was unlikely to match what I had. Probably not in terms of salary, almost definitely not in terms of prestige or meaningful decisions available. That's what I thought anyway.

In the end it wasn't a tough choice. It just required paying attention to that internal alarm and a compass pointing to one specific direction. I'm a lot happier now. I no longer [end the week with nothing](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing).

One of the most fortunate coincidences is that creating things yourself is the only way to really learn how the whole modern web stack comes together. That's also the most gratifying part for me, the new-found ability to create, accompanied by a need to do so. That's at the core of what code means for me. It has made music sound better.

If you're interested in the specific resources I used to make this switch, I've listed the best ones [in this post](/blog/starter-pack).

Listen to the signals, observe the compass.

Don't despair.
