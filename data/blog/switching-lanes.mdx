My first programming project was a little Python script running on my mobile, which helped even out household finances. I ran it on the [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com) code playground, having picked up the basic Python syntax from their mobile mini-lessons as well as the [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) book.

For one reason or another, I didn't pursue programming seriously until several years later.

That was a mistake.

I ended most weeks with nothing. (link here)

There's a podcast episode, probably the best single podcast episode I've listened to, which articulates many of the extremely primitive and guttural feelings I experienced. These include, paraphrased, getting signals from your body that say "if you stay here, you're going to die".

There's a concept of "the dark night of the soul", which simplifies to people not willing to accept their own creativity.

The concept of fitness landscapes

In order for them to experiment with going to become a photographer or something that really is calling their attention, the bliss that is calling with them, they have to give up so much fitness and they have to sacrifice so much, not just for them, but for their families.

You start off as a child completely engaged in the world. You get more and more powerful and more and more abstracted as the ego takes more and more control. And then you need to relinquish your power.

The map and the territory, the model and the reality.

I'd had a lingering thought of building something to replace the spreadsheets my uncle always emailed ahead of a major international football tournament and a related family competition. That thought stayed with me and eventually become my first fullstack web app.

Having a clear target with defined users helped me maintain focus during my first year of learning to code, and the completion of that project marked the transition from apprentice to journeyman. Well, at least into a competent beginner. The point is, it helps to have a project in mind.

Attention is your most valuable resource.
