I was miserable.

I lived in one of the greatest cities in the world, worked for one of the best companies in my field and was about to become a father. I had a wonderful woman by my side to share all this with. I was fortunate.

Yet there was a primitive and guttural alarm inside me signaling that if I stayed the course, something terrible was going to happen. I ignored it.

After more than a year of my general enjoyment of most things steadily fading, I caught a lifeline. Thankfully, this happened before I had absent-mindedly let everything dear to me float away.

### Distress signal decoded

I started dabbling in computer programming. Learning new thought patterns, solving tough problems, speaking a completely new language unlike any I knew before. Thrilled about the challenge unveiled, I threw myself into code with fire and vigor I'd almost forgotten existed.

This felt like a thing I'd been missing. I was typing away at least a couple of hours every night for months on end, after the little one had gone to sleep. Then again, London was locked down and there wasn't a whole lot else to do anyway.

Modern JavaScript syntax with functional programming techniques. Low-level access via C. Immutable, unidirectional data flows. Declarative and imperative paradigms, relational and non-relational databases. Little by little, my Swiss-cheese knowledge was filling in.

Sustained effort is not magic, although the outcome regularly feels like it.

### Fitness landscapes

What may be a bigger hurdle is overcoming one's ego.

Changing careers means sliding down the slope of your local peak, setting out to find a better vantage point. It's a whole new mountain to climb and there are no guarantees.

For me, the specific hurdle was nine years of fairly high-profile experience in financial journalism and industry-standard [qualifications](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa) that I'd spent about 1,000 hours on obtaining.

Like with any new language, I felt like an idiot muddling through rudimentary expressions.

I suspected that entering a new field was unlikely to match what I had. Probably not in terms of salary, almost definitely not in terms of prestige or meaningful decisions available. Nor the fuzzy warm feeling of actually knowing what you're doing.

### Chase your bliss

In the end, it wasn't a tough choice. It was time to divert course, the internal compass was clear.

The infamous search for the first programming job worked out well. I'm a lot happier than recently and the horizon seems broader.

If you're interested in the specific resources I used to make this career switch, I've curated the best ones [in this post](/blog/starter-pack). There are no affiliate connections, just trying to pass it forward.

Listen to the signals, observe the compass.

Don't despair.
