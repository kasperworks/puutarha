So you want to learn to code. Great! Let's get you started.

Think of something you want to build. It doesn't need to be anything grand, but it should feel fun, exciting and maybe even useful.

Setting up a blog, making a game, writing a script to automate a daily routine. If you thought of something, brilliant! Hold that thought. If not, read on, we'll revisit.

Learning to code will require spending a big chunk of your free time immersed in the subject, for at least about a year. This process may be faster if you don't need to work a full-time job, or be a parent, or have other interests and obligations, but it's also possible to do with all and any such things. I think. Still, it's a lot of work.

Web development isn't the only way to a coding career, but it's probably the fastest. You can build almost anything with JavaScript, and you get to build things pretty soon after starting.

By mastering the skills and the fundamental principles I'll try to introduce here means you'll have the capacity to work in a junior developer role: meaningfully contributing to large web apps and constructing smaller ones from start to finish. I know this, because <abbr title="Past performance may not be indicative of future results." style={{ cursor: 'help' }}>that's what I did.</abbr>

Below you'll find a curated list of the most impactful learning resources I encountered after I got serious about learning to code in 2020. These are the big ones that really ignited the spark and kept me going, the ones that drove a successful [career pivot](/blog/switching-lanes). Most of these assets are free, the rest are affordable. All are worth it, recommended with five stars and a full heart.

**Learn website layouts**

- Study HTML/CSS at [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
- Focus on [Flexbox](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Grid](https://cssgridgarden.com/)
- Get familiar with [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) early on. Seriously, it is an absolute treasure.

**Get acquainted with your tools**

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the industry standard for writing code. If you have a favorite, by all means use that, just don't use Notepad.
- [Git](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron). You should learn [Git](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) for version control, and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources) too.
- If you're running Windows, install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). On macOS or Linux, you're fine for now.

**Establish fundamentals**

- Harvard's [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/). I can't speak highly enough of this course, just a phenomenal introduction to all things computer science. It's mostly not in JavaScript, but it's extremely applicable.
- University of Helsinkiâ€™s programming intro is an excellent follow-up to further solidify the foundation. Less computer science, more coding. In [Python](https://ohjelmointi-21.mooc.fi/) in Finnish, in [Java](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) in English.
- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) on Coursera. You're going to be doing a lot of learning for a long time, this is worth taking early.

**Get to the JavaScript part already!**

- Pick up [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) and [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-definitive/9781491952016/). Do get the newest editions if you can.
- Enroll on [The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/). Make sure you get the big Udemy discount, they're almost always on.
- Start practicing some quiz-like problems at [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) and [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) to reinforce the habit of writing code. [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a good option for practicing algorithm skills, which may be useful in job interviews, depending on where you're applying. [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) is another alternative focused on data skills, with gamified progression and short lectures.

\*_Dip into React, or Vue_

- You'll most likely want to learn at least one major framework for building user interfaces. A short, free [video course](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) about the very basics of React is hosted at Egghead, by Kent C. Dodds. Highly recommended, probably worth watching in its entirety at least twice.
- Dave Ceddia's [Pure React](https://www.purereact.com/) book limits focus on just the core functionalities of React, which I found very helpful when starting out.
- [Vue](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-3/intro-to-vue3/) is another popular JS framework that you may wish to consider. By all means explore the syntax of both and your relevant job market, but don't overthink it. Just pick one of them and get started.

**Build something**

- That thing you wanted to build? The one I asked about at the start? Now's a good time to do something about it, if you haven't already.
- Don't know what to build? Try Wes Bos's [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/), an absolute goldmine of little projects you can complete in a day. The JavaScript refresher will come in handy too, it's 100% worthwhile to keep improving those Vanilla JS skills while learning React!

**Apply for first developer jobs**

- Send a few applications when you've made it to this point, maybe even sooner. I asked and received very valuable feedback from my first rejections, including the importance of having some coding projects of your own to discuss.
- Look into contributing to open source. Perhaps a library you've found useful, maybe fixing out-of-date documentation or writing a few tests. You'll learn about pull requests and train yourself to read code written by others, which is a crucial skill. [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/) is a good place to start. [Here's mine](https://firstpr.me/#kasperworks)!

Alternatives exist to everything listed here, feel free to explore them. It's probably a good idea to do so, sometimes things click when you get bombarded by the same idea from different angles.

However, I'd urge any budding programmers also to resist the temptation to micro-optimize their learning path. What matters is getting started and sticking with it; writing code, day after day. Make it a habit.

Once you do, remember that tutorials are handy, but creating things yourself is the only way to learn how the whole modern web-app stack comes together. If it occasionally feels like a struggle, that's good. Undertakings that feel just a little bit beyond reach are the best: not overwhelming, but difficult enough to stimulate growth.

Build small projects you can throw away and learn from. Build large projects that you can use, take apart, scrap and make better. Read as much as you can about everything you don't understand.

Focus on ES6+ syntax with functional programming techniques. Discover immutable, unidirectional data flows. Find out about atomic design. Ponder the differences between declarative and imperative code, relational and non-relational databases. Look into finite-state machines. Little by little, your Swiss-cheese knowledge will fill in.

I'd recommend not limiting yourself to any single narrowly defined realm of programming, but rather think of yourself as a problem solver.

Once you've gained momentum, keep on creating things. Explore stuff you're interested in. Maybe it involves wrangling sports data with Python to visualize in [D3](https://d3js.org/), perhaps writing compilers and containers in Go is your thing.

Then do whatever you want. You can speak to golems.
