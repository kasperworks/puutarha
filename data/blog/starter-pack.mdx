So you want to learn to code. Great! Let's get you started.

Think of something you want to build. It doesn't need to be anything grand, but it should be fun and exciting. Bonus points for useful.

A travel blog, a mobile game, a script to automate a daily routine, a spreadsheet replacement. If you thought of something, brilliant! Hold that thought. If not, read on, we'll revisit.

Web development isn't the only path to a coding career, but it's probably the fastest one. You can build almost anything with JavaScript, and you get to build things pretty soon after starting. I'd recommend focusing on ES6+ syntax with functional programming techniques. That sentence may not make sense yet, but it will.

This is a curated list of the most impactful learning resources I encountered, the ones that really fueled the fire and led to a successful [career pivot](/blog/crossing-over-to-tech). Most of them are free, the rest are affordable. All are worth it, recommended with five stars and a full heart.

**Learn website layouts**

- Study HTML/CSS at [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
- Focus on [Flexbox](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Grid](https://cssgridgarden.com/)
- Get familiar with [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) early on. Seriously, it is an absolute treasure.

**Get acquainted with your tools**

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the industry standard for writing code. If you have a favorite, by all means use that, just don't use Notepad.
- [Git](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron). You should learn [Git](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) for version control, and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources) too.
- If you're running Windows, install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). On macOS or Linux, you're fine for now.

**Establish fundamentals**

- Harvard's [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/). I can't speak highly enough of this course, just a phenomenal introduction to all things computer science. It's mostly not in JavaScript, but it's extremely applicable.
- University of Helsinkiâ€™s programming intro is an excellent follow-up to further solidify the foundation. In [Python](https://ohjelmointi-21.mooc.fi/) in Finnish, in [Java](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) in English.
- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) on Coursera. You're going to be doing a lot of learning for a long time, this is worth taking early.

**Get to the JavaScript part already!**

- Pick up [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) and [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-definitive/9781491952016/). Do get the newest editions if you can.
- Enroll on [The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/). Make sure you get the big Udemy discount, they're almost always on.

**Dip into React, or Vue**

- You'll want to learn at least one major framework for building user interfaces. Dave Ceddia's [Pure React](https://www.purereact.com/) book limits focus on just the core functionalities of React, which I found very helpful when starting out.
- [Vue](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-3/intro-to-vue3/) is another popular JS framework that you may wish to consider. By all means explore the syntax and the job market, but don't overthink it; just pick one of them and get started.

**Build something**

- Don't know what to build? Try Wes Bos's [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/), an absolute goldmine of little projects you can complete in a day. The JavaScript refresher will come in handy too.

**Apply for first developer jobs**

- Send a few applications when you've made it to this point, maybe even sooner. I got very valuable feedback from my first rejections, particularly about the importance of having some projects of your own to show prospective employers.
- Look into contributing to open source. Perhaps a library you've found useful, maybe fixing out-of-date documentation or writing a few tests. You'll learn about pull requests and train yourself to read code written by others, which is an important skill. [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/) is a good place to start. [Here's mine](https://firstpr.me/#kasperworks)!

Alternatives exist to everything listed here, feel free to explore them. Yet I'd urge any budding programmers to resist the temptation to micro-optimize their learning path. What matters is getting started and sticking with it; writing code, day after day.

Tutorials are handy, but building things yourself is the only way to learn how things fit. Read as much as you can about everything you don't understand. Little by little, your Swiss cheese knowledge will fill in.

Once you do gain some momentum, keep on creating things with the knowledge you have acquired. Explore things you're interested in. Maybe it involves wrangling some sports data with Python to visualize in D3, or perhaps writing compilers in Go is your thing.

In any case you shouldn't limit yourself to any single narrowly defined realm of programming, but rather think of yourself as a problem solver.

You've got this!
