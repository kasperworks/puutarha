So you want to learn to code. Great! Let's get you started.

Think of something you want to build. It doesn't need to be tomorrow, it doesn't need to be anything grand. Should be fun though, bonus points for useful.

A personal website, a game, a spreadsheet replacement, a blog, something to automate a daily routine. If you thought of something, brilliant! Hold that thought.
If not, read on, we'll revisit.

My first programming project was a little Python script running on my mobile, which helped even out household finances. My spouse had a variable income, mine was fixed.
We agreed on each paying a percentage of that month's net salary to cover some essential living expenses.

The script accepted a number and spat out two to determine our respective monthly living expenses. We used it for a good while, it worked. I ran it on the [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com) code playground, having picked up the basic Python syntax from their mobile mini-lessons as well as the [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) book.

For one reason or another, I didn't pursue programming seriously until several years later. I had daydreamed about making an app for an extended family tradition: predicting the outcomes of international football tournaments. That would become my first fullstack web app, replacing spreadsheets.

The following assets helped me build that app and establish strong enough skills to secure my first programming job. This is a curated list of the best learning resources I encountered. Most of them are free, the rest are affordable. All are worth it, recommended with five stars and a full heart.

### Building blocks to basic competency:

- **Learn website layouts**
  - Study HTML/CSS at [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
  - Focus on [Flexbox](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Grid](https://cssgridgarden.com/)
  - Get familiar with [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) early on. Seriously, it is an absolute treasure.
- **Add interaction via JavaScript**
  - Pick up [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) and [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-definitive/9781491952016/). Do get the newest editions if you can.
  - Enroll on [The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/) by Colt Steele and Stephen Grider at Udemy. Both are very good teachers. Make sure you get the big discount, they're almost always on.
- **Establish fundamentals**
  - Harvard's [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/). I can't speak highly enough of this course. Just a phenomenal introduction to all things computer science.
  - University of Helsinkiâ€™s programming intro. An excellent follow-up, further solidified the foundation. In [Python](https://ohjelmointi-21.mooc.fi/) in Finnish, in [Java](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) in English.
- **Dip into React**
  - Learn enough to be useful via Dave Ceddia's book, Stephen Grider's course, Wes Bos's Gatsby course
- **Apply for first junior developer jobs**
  - My first round of applications led to one interview and project exercise. I was rejected, but received valuable feedback on how important it is to build something your own.
- Build a frontend prototype of a football tournament app in a week in December 2020, seek feedback from a small group of users, family
- Apply for other jobs, get three offers
- Pick the one that feels right
