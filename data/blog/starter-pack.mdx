So you want to learn to code. Great! Let's get you started.

Think of something you want to build. It doesn't need to be tomorrow, it doesn't need to be anything grand. Should be fun though, bonus points for useful.

A personal website, a game, a spreadsheet replacement, a blog, something to automate a daily routine. If you thought of something, brilliant! Hold that thought. If not, read on, we'll revisit.

My first programming project was a little Python script running on my mobile, which helped even out household finances. I ran it on the [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com) code playground, having picked up the basic Python syntax from their mobile mini-lessons as well as the [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) book.

For one reason or another, I didn't pursue programming seriously until several years later. I had daydreamed about making an app for an extended family tradition: predicting the outcomes of international football tournaments. That would become my first fullstack web app, replacing spreadsheets.

The following assets helped me build that app and establish strong enough skills to secure my first programming job. This is a curated list of the best learning resources I encountered. Most of them are free, the rest are affordable. All are worth it, recommended with five stars and a full heart.

### Building blocks to basic competency:

**Learn website layouts**

- Study HTML/CSS at [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
- Focus on [Flexbox](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Grid](https://cssgridgarden.com/)
- Get familiar with [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) early on. Seriously, it is an absolute treasure.
  **Add interaction via JavaScript**
- Pick up [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) and [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-definitive/9781491952016/). Do get the newest editions if you can.
- Enroll on [The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/) by Colt Steele and Stephen Grider at Udemy. Both are very good teachers. Make sure you get the big Udemy discount, they're almost always on.
  **Establish fundamentals**
- Harvard's [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/). I can't speak highly enough of this course. Just a phenomenal introduction to all things computer science.
- University of Helsinkiâ€™s programming intro. An excellent follow-up, further solidified the foundation. In [Python](https://ohjelmointi-21.mooc.fi/) in Finnish, in [Java](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) in English.
- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) on Coursera. A very interesting and actionable primer on some learning techniques. You're going to be doing a lot of learning for a long time, this is worth taking early.
  **Dip into React**
- Perhaps the most useful single resource for this very popular framework I found was Dave Ceddia's [Pure React](https://www.purereact.com/) book, which narrows down focus on just the core functionalities of React and involves doing a bunch of very small throwaway projects. A great way to gain some confidence and really understand what you're doing.
- Vue is another popular JS framework that you may prefer. I have no real opinion on it as I picked React as my primary focus area, but you may find Vue more enjoyable or relevant to your interests. Once you get up to speed, you can probably learn the other one quite quickly if you need. Just pick one and get started, that's what matters.
  **Build something**
- Don't know what to build? Try Wes Bos's [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/), an absolute goldmine of little projects you can complete in a day. The JavaScript refresher will come in handy too.
- Build something more. Make it a bit bigger this time, that's the only way you learn how all the pieces fit together. The only way you'll fill in the Swiss cheese knowledge you've gained thus far. In my case, the big endeavor was replacing some emailed spreadsheets on a family football tournament with a sleek fullstack app, my first one. The milestone marking the transition from apprentice to journeyman. Well, at least a competent beginner. For this, I used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) hosting and serverless functions with [Fauna](https://fauna.com/) backend. Another good option to host and deploy your stuff easily is [Vercel](https://vercel.com), on the backend [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) looks easy and intriguing.
  **Apply for first developer jobs**
- Send a few applications when you've made it to this point, maybe even sooner. Even if you feel you're not quite ready. I got very valuable feedback from my first rejections, specifically about the importance of having some projects of your own to show prospective employers. I also gained confidence for having made it through a couple of initial rounds and getting an impression of the screening process and the required skills.

This is the point I succeeded in getting hired in my first programming role. Don't get discouraged if you don't experience similar good fortune, there's always an element of luck involved. Keep on building things with the knowledge you have acquired thus far explore things you're interested in. Maybe it involves data wrangling with Python, maybe building servers and APIs with Node.

As a general rule on what to learn for advanced beginners, I'd recommend sticking to things you can use right away, even for a practice project. Don't learn anything "just in case". There are so many tools, programming languages and ecosystems that it's easy to get overwhelmed. Creating and building is fun, and also the best way to learn!
