My posts in this blog almost always start with scattered hand-written notes.

I then type them up with light editing, categorizing in Notion snippets. Some of them
start forming a narrative. I try to let it happen.

I find it helps me remembers the important bits. Hopefully they can be helpful to someone
else too, in one way or another. I don't know what it all means or what's a thing that
everyone should do. I don't have 7 easy tricks to make you rich.

I seek resonance with what I've written. It's very difficult to express some of these
things verbally, at least partly because I feel they're not verbal in nature.

This is my best attempt of catching that lightning in a bottle.

### Flow

Flow is an aid to connect with a greater sense of meaning in life, 
learn important skills faster and improve expert intuition. 

It can set in motion an insight cascade. Flow requires clear information, tightly coupled feedback loops, 
and an environment where errors matter. Resistance of some sort.

I find flow in programming reasonably oftern, often enough to go look for it in that activity. 
When it happens, it seems to have welcome effects on completely unrelated things: 
an acute observation about a relationship, a mental block disappearing, 
a keen sense of direction. Those kinds of things.

The moments I've felt the most lost and despairing in my life are also the times I've consciously
attempted to suppress intuition I can't explain and verbalize, reason and justify.

From personal experience, I believe the Western thought I have been immersed in since childhood 
has a fake dualism between intuition and intellect, emotion and rationality. I greatly value
the Age of Enlightenment and its legacy. Yet I think Descartes had it wrong.

There's probably something to observing myths, quotes and stories as tools to 
realign ourselves with what's meaningful and durable.

The stuff that truly sticks with you is trying to tell you something.

Pay attention! Attention is costly and finite. It may be your most valuable asset.

This is related to both ancient Chinese philosophy as well as latest advances in neuroscience.

Music is not irrational, it’s suprarational, beyond reason.

The right hemisphere of the brain can include the observations of the left side in its insights, 
but the left side cannot see what the right one is doing.

The left hemisphere lies, the right one does not. The right hemisphere is connected to the world, the left one abstracts it.

It's very beneficial to have some slack, some inefficiency in the system.
