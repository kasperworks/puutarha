This is my personal site, [kasper.works](https://kasper.works).

Built with Next.js, MDX, Styled Components, Framer Motion and a few other libraries. This is my first real project on Next.js, thus it's almost certainly not a showcase of best practices. However, it is functional and it looks good. Most importantly, it offers me a platform to write on.
