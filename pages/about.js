          <p>
            I wrote about financial markets and related topics for nine years before
            pivoting to programming.

            In the past, you might have caught me on Bloomberg TV or radio, talking about
            the latest earnings season, an industry trend or an acquisition announced
            earlier that morning. Before that, I used to DJ, write record reviews and
            design flyers.

            These days I&apos;m more likely to be building an interactive data
            visualization or tinkering with a cloud-service script at Yle, Finlandâ€™s
            public broadcasting company.
