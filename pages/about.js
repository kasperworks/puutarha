            Hi! I&apos;m Kasper, a journalist with a long-standing interest in technology.
            I wrote about financial markets and related topics for nearly a decade before
            pivoting to programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the past, you might have caught me on Bloomberg TV or radio, talking about
            the latest earnings season, an industry trend or an acquisition announced
            earlier that morning. Before that, I used to DJ, write record reviews and
            design flyers.
          </p>
          <p>
            These days I&apos;m more likely to be building an interactive data
            visualization or tinkering with a cloud-service script at Yle, Finland’s
            public broadcasting company.
